## Intrusion_Detection_with_unsupervised_Learning

This is the final project for advanced machine learning course represented by [Rahnema College](https://rahnemacollege.com/). In this project, we were asked to identify intrusion in a system, which relies on the analysis of logs. Since the ground truth labels of anomalous behaviors were not given to us, we had to use unsupervised anomaly detection methods.

## Dataset
Since the dataset cannot be publicly published, in order to get the sense of it, a few samples are shown below.

* 207.213.193.143 [2021-5-12T5:6:0.0+0430] [Get /cdn/profiles/1026106239] 304 0 [[Googlebot-Image/1.0]] 32

idea and goal of a project 

structure of ptoject )map)

what are features

explaining scraping data(sample)

finding sessions (explaining how i defined them)

results of different approaches(prefereably graphs )

deep learning training process !!!

comparing results
