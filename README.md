# Intrusion detection with unsupervised learning

This is the final project for advanced machine learning course represented by [Rahnema College](https://rahnemacollege.com/). In this project, we were tasked with identifying intrusions in a system, relying on the analysis of logs. Since the ground truth labels for anomalous behaviors weren't provided, we had to employ unsupervised anomaly detection methods.

## Dataset.
Because the dataset cannot be shared publicly, we've included a few samples below to give you an idea of its content.

## Workflow
- Data Cleaning and EDA:
    - We performed data cleaning by removing unnecessary characters, modifying data types, and identifying missing values. We handled these issues using suitable approaches, along with visualizations.
- Finding Sessions:
  - We identified sessions for each unique pair of IP addresses and user agents, incorporating a 30-minute interval between two consecutive sessions.
- Feature Engineering:
  - num_requests
  - Image_to_request ratio
  - Percentage of `4xx` error responses
  - Percentage of `HTTP` requests of type `HEAD`
  - Standard deviation of the requested pageâ€™s depth
  - Percentage of consecutively repeated `HTTP` requests
  - Average and sum of response length and response time for each session
  - Session duration
  - Average time per page
  - Robot.txt file request
- Scraped Well-Known Crawlers.
- Data Transformation Experimentation:
  - We experimented with various data transformation techniques, including Power, Quantile, Logarithmic, Reciprocal, Square Root, Exponential, and Box-Cox transformations.
- Anomaly Detection:
  - Isolation Forest
  - Gaussian mixture models
  - Autoencoders
