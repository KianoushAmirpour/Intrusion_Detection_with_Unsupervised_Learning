# Intrusion_Detection_with_unsupervised_Learning

This is the final project for advanced machine learning course represented by [Rahnema College] (https://rahnemacollege.com/). In this project, we were asked to identify intrusion in a system, which relies on the analysis of logs. Since the ground truth labels of anomalous behaviors were not given to us, we had to use unsupervised anomaly detection methods.

### Dataset
Since I can't publish the dataset, in order to get more familiar with what it looks like, a few samples of it are shown below.

idea and goal of a project 

structure of ptoject )map)

what are features

explaining scraping data(sample)

finding sessions (explaining how i defined them)

results of different approaches(prefereably graphs )

deep learning training process !!!

comparing results
